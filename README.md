# Flex

A "simple" plate deformation project: given a rectangular or circular plate of specified dimensions,
 plot and measure the deformation across the plate. This program is run by a GUI.

Files:

DesignProject_GUI.fig -- GUI Interface (figure) to the program
DesignProject_GUI.m -- GUI Interface (script) to the program

plate_deformation.m -- primary function that calculates and plots the deformation, returns the maximum value

Report.pdf -- a .pdf report, describing the project, displaying test cases, and also holding the code

Report.odt -- the file on which Report.pdf was exported from
