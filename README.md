# Flex

A "simple" plate deformation project.

Files:

Returns a vector of z-deformation (Radius, Z)
circ_plate_point_deform.m -- calculates the deformation of a circular plate given pressure on centerpoint
circ_plate_surface_deform.m -- calculates the deformation of a curcular plate given pressure over surface

Returns a 2D matrix of z-deformation (X, Y, Z)
[DONE - Jack] rect_plate_point_deform.m -- calculates the deformation of a rectangular plate given pressure on centerpoint
rect_plate_surface_deform.m -- calculates the deformation of a rectangular plate given pressure over surface

sum_deform.m -- sums deformations
